# Welcome to vddgroupdial - Help Manual

This extension is designed to provide you with an advanced, private, and customizable visual organizational panel (Speed Dial), categorizing your most-used links (bookmarks or *dials*) through different groups ("Boards").

Below we explain the main functionalities of the extension step by step.

---

## 1. Groups (Boards)

The extension is divided into "Groups". Think of them as tabs in a general folder.
*   **Create a new Group**: In the top bar, to the right of your current tabs, you will find a **`+`** button. Clicking it will instantly create a new blank environment.
*   **Edit Group**: Right-click or use the "Hamburger" menu and select **Edit group** (Advanced Option for the currently visible selected group). You can also use the **gear** button integrated into each group to access the Advanced Editing Modal.
*   **Delete Group**: You can do this from the Hamburger Menu -> Delete Group, which will erase that set of bookmarks forever.

### 1.1 Advanced Group Configuration (Smart Modal)
Inside *Edit Group*, you will have a window structured into 4 vital tabs whose visualizations act **in real-time**:
*   **General**: Modify the group name. Adapt the base structure: Decide if you prefer a "Dynamic" layout (auto-adjusting to its content in list or grid form) or a strict "Grid" where you can set Columns and Rows numerically to your liking.
*   **Appearance**: Modify the Font Color used for texts and choose from more than 15 different Icons to visually represent your group in the top bar.
*   **Background**: Bring your boards to life. You can use solid base colors (#HEX), design a linear gradient indicating degrees (e.g. 90deg or 180deg) with two colors, make an elliptical "spotlight" style radial gradient, or even load a Background Image by directly embedding its URL.
*   **Slides**: Parametrically adjust the "Gap" (central opening between cards) using the slider between 0px and 100px.
*   **Configuration**: Pin this group to be the first one when starting the browser ("Set as Default"). **Security Novelty**: Activate **"Lock this group"**. An option will appear for you to generate a custom password for that block of links. Whenever you want to enter or edit that group, you will be asked for this key first. If you forget it, the master key is `0000`.

## 2. Bookmarks (Dials / Slides)

For each group you choose, a window is revealed to store *Dials* at will.
*   **Add a new one**: Click on the translucent central circle with a giant `+` or right-click on an empty space. You will be asked for URL, Title, and image/thumbnail.
*   **Structured Edition**: With `Edit Mode` active, each bookmark shows two small menus when hovering the mouse. The Edit "Pencil" (allows renaming the card) and the red Trash can.
*   **Drag & Drop**: You can manually change the order of any Slide by keeping the left click pressed on it and dropping it on top of any other companion. (Note: This is not possible if the current group is "Password Locked").

### 2.1 Contextual Sorting
*   If you **Right-click** on the background of your group (where your bookmarks float), a special floating glass menu (*Glassmorphism Context Menu*) will be revealed.
*   In this submenu, you can click to organize your grid by:
    *   **Alphabetical** (From A-Z or Z-A taking the titles).
    *   **Age** (Newest uploaded first or the historical classic).
The screen will update automatically.

## 3. Ultra-fast Search Engine

Do you have many boards and can't find a link?
*   Use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + F` (or `Cmd + Shift + F` on MAC). Alternatively, use the main Hamburger Menu -> "Search slide...".
*   A powerful centralized search engine will pop up. Type any term ("YouTube", "Banking") and it will scan in parallel through Titles and URLs across all groups. Click on the result and you will go straight to your page.

## 4. Import, Export and Share (Advanced Mode)

Privacy and data ownership are controlled by you with 3 large blocks integrated without the internet:
*   **Native Import**: Massively import the classic *built-in Bookmarks* from your Firefox/Chrome into the visualization memory of the Speed Dial.
*   **Import HTML / Netscape**: Click on the Global Menu -> Global Settings (Sidebar) -> Import .HTML. Uploading backups from other browsers.
*   **Save / Select Multiple**: Click on Menu -> Share slides. A dark bottom bar will be injected indicating "Selection Mode Active". Clicking on the cards will fill them with "☑" ticks. You will be able to Export to HTML or simply Dump to Plain Text the content of your exclusive choices.

## 5. Thumbnail Access (Live Updates)

Sometimes some web URLs' logos or favicons don't load the first day the URL is uploaded to the server.
*   **Popup Tab**: Click on the extension's own icon to the right of the browser's search bar. If you hit an "Add / Create group" button, the web page that is open will be injected.
*   **Manual reloads**: In the Hamburger menu enter **Update thumbnails >**. You will see options to force the core to download fresh visuals to all cards or only search for the "Broken / Fallen" ones (the ones that show up gray or transparent).
